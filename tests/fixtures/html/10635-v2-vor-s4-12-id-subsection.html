<h4>Calculation of the number of docked LDCVs per chromaffin cell</h4><p>The size of the pool of docked LDCVs per cell can be calculated from the number of LDCVs per µm² PM area (n<sub>a</sub>) (<a class="xref-bibr" href="#bib50">Parsons et al., 1995</a>; <a class="xref-bibr" href="#bib52">Plattner et al., 1997</a>). We measured the number of membrane-proximal LDCVs (0–40 nm of PM) per µm PM length (n<sub>l</sub>) in ultrathin sections of 0.05 µm thickness. Our 3D-ET approach permitted us to accurately measure LDCV diameters (d<sub>v</sub> in µm) in chromaffin cells (<a class="xref-fig" href="#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). The number of LDCVs per µm² PM area could then be calculated as n<sub>a</sub> = n<sub>l</sub>/(d<sub>v</sub> + 0.05) (<a class="xref-bibr" href="#bib50">Parsons et al., 1995</a>; <a class="xref-bibr" href="#bib52">Plattner et al., 1997</a>). The average cell surface area (a<sub>c</sub> in µm<sup>2</sup>) per genotype was estimated based on the average cell capacitance measured in cultured cells assuming 1 μF/cm<sup>2</sup>. We chose this method, rather than using the cell circumference measured in ultrathin sections, because the chromaffin cells in adrenal slices are not round, but have rather complex shapes (<a class="xref-fig" href="#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). Using either measurement, the <em>Unc13a</em><sup>KO</sup><em>Unc13b</em><sup>KO</sup> cells were slightly larger, by 5% based on capacitance, and by 15% based on cell circumference measurements.</p><p><em>Unc13a</em><sup>Het</sup><em>Unc13b</em><sup>Het</sup> control cells:</p><p>n<sub>l:</sub> 0.984 ± 0.075 vesicles per µm length</p><p>d<sub>v</sub>: 0.1627 ± 0.005 µm vesicle diameter</p><p>n<sub>a</sub>: 4.627 vesicles per µm² PM area</p><p>a<sub>c</sub>: 421.23 µm² cell membrane area</p><p>The estimated number of LDCVs within 40 nm of the PM in <em>Unc13a</em><sup>Het</sup><em>Unc13b</em><sup>Het</sup> chromaffin cells is therefore ~1949.
