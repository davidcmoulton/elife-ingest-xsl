<h3>Discussion</h3><p>How are these results relevant to predict the grid configuration expressed in 3D, and that can be tested in a flying bat? Our model points towards a hierarchy of timescales, associated with the emergence of periodical spatial activity of increasing complexity. To establish a relation between our results and a real bat, it is necessary to specify the actual values of the temporal and spatial parameters of our model, to obtain a time scale for the development of the grids that we can then compare with experimental findings.</p><p>If we take time steps of size Δ<em>t</em> = 10 <em>ms</em> and an average bat velocity of <em>v</em> = 1 <em>m/s</em>, the small environment used in most of our simulations will correspond to a cubic room of size <em>L</em> = 2.5 <em>m</em>. Then, with this choice of parameters, grids are formed with a field spacing of 2.5 <em>m</em> × 0.55 ≈ 1.4 <em>m</em> and an interlayer distance of <span class="inline-formula"><span class="mathjax mml-math"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mn>2.5</mn><mi>m</mi><mo>×</mo><mn>0.55</mn><mo>×</mo><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mn>6</mn></msqrt></mrow><mn>3</mn></mfrac><mo>≈</mo><mn>1.1</mn><mi>m</mi></mrow></math></span></span>. The time scale of grid formation can be calculated considering that 1 million simulation time steps correspond to 10,000 s or nearly 3 hr. Our model then predicts, in an environment the size of ours, the presence of (i) triplets of fields forming roughly equilateral triangles in ≈10–12 hr of continuous flight, (ii) hexagons in ≈15–18 hr, and finally (iii) different units that achieve a common orientation after ≈30–35 hr. These time scales do not seem very different from those predicted by the same model for the development of grids in a two-dimensional environment of similar linear size (relative to the grid spacing). Figure 6 in <a class="xref-bibr" href="#bib19">Si et al. (2012</a>) indicates a time scale of about 20,000 s, or 5–6 hr, for the development of gridness in 2D. At the same time, this moderate increase in grid formation time might make it comparable to the flight time available for spatial learning during bat experiments. In these conditions, even the weak, sub-linear dependence of time scales with volume, that we do observe, may be sufficient to determine a switch between the possibility of forming regular structures and leaving them beyond reach.</p><p>A regular tiling of the environment (either in the form of an FCC or of an HCP lattice) is a different story, even though it would be the optimal arrangement from an information-theoretic perspective (<a class="xref-bibr" href="#bib16">Mathis et al., 2014</a>). The total simulation time would correspond to a maximum of ≈80–90 hr of continuous bat flight in the (2.5 <em>m</em>)<sup>3</sup> volume. This time is just a lower bound for the time necessary to form a regular tiling of the environment, and likely a loose one, as our simulations do not seem to be converging towards one of them.</p><p>These considerations suggest that bats may form a partially regular 3D tiling of the environment at most once, and then possibly only if constrained to fly for a prolonged time in a rather small cage, while a completely regular, crystalline tiling of space seems to be hardly in the range of time available to real bats.</p><p>In conclusion, the presence of an additional dimension does not seem to preclude the appearance of some orderly arrangement of the fields in mEC units of bats. Nevertheless, this order might express only a partial set of the full spectrum of potential three-dimensional symmetry properties. It might be still sufficient to distinguish the activity of these cells from a random multi-peaked pattern, but it would place it at a substantial distance from a perfectly regular pattern, too. In our model this distance varies across a population of cells: some of them show only small deviations from perfect symmetry. We thus cannot exclude the possibility of finding some of these extreme cases in real animals. At the same time, the vast majority of simulated grid cells are very far from a perfectly regular arrangement and while the number of units actually found in the tails of the distribution of scores might be strongly dependent on some specific factors of the development of grid cells, the bulk of grid-like but imperfect cells can be regarded as a robust aspect of our model, and might extend to very different situations of 3D grid cell development, possibly including other species experiencing three-dimensional navigation.</p>
