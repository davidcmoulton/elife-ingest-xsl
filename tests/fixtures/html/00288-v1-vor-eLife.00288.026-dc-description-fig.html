Containment of infected cells within a single ulcer is extremely rapid, although secondary ulcers explain prolonged episodes. (A) Episode duration was a function of the number of ulcers before episode termination during 500 simulated episodes. (B)â€“(E) A 10-day simulated episode consisting of 24 ulcers: (B) Total cell-free virus (red) over time reflects the saw-tooth pattern of prolonged episodes; virus produced from the initial ulcer (red dotted line) was eliminated within 3 days. (C) Infected cells were eliminated from the initial viral ulcer (green dotted line) within 1 day and there were four periods during the episode when no infected cells were present. (D) Cell-free virus (red), cell-associated virus (blue), and infected cells (green) were eliminated from the primary ulcer with different kinetics; infected cells peaked at 13 hr and were extinguished in &lt;24 hr (E) Secondary ulcers prolonged episodes; each thin line represents HSV-2 production from a specific region.
